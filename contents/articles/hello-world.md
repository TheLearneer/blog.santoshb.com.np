Hello There!

First of all **Thank you** by taking your time to head over to my blog and read this article. I hope you are doing well.
Before starting anything it is always good to know each other. I do also like to tell people who I am and know about more people.
You will be able to know more about me when you read through this entire article.

## About Me
If you are new to me (It's obvious though), then the first question ringing your head is preety much *Who is this guy?*

Just to introduce myself, I am a lad from **Nepal**. I do love lots of stuffs like programming, watching movies, playing sports, playing mobile games and lots of other stuffs.
Having lots of interest in computer and related stuffs, I am studying *Computer Engineering*. I always have lots of interest towards technology and stuffs.

I have learned few of those stuffs like <u>*Visual Basics*</u>, <u>*C*</u>, <u>*C++*</u>, <u>*Javascript*</u> and <u>*Node.js*</u>, <u>*Vue*</u> and <u>*Nuxt*</u>. I do have good amount of knowledge about all these stuffs.
Aside from these, I have also learnt to use tools like <u>*Visual Studio*</u>, <u>*Visual Studio Code*</u> and <u>*GIT*</u>.
Aside from *C* and *C++* I have self taught all these stuffs, all because I am interested in such stuffs and I am always keen to learn more.
Next up what I am to learn is *Python* and *AI*(Artificial Intelligence).

With that being said, you will preety much learn more about me with time going on if you keep reading to my articles.

## My Motive
Did you ask to yourself *Why should I read this blog?*
It's amazing if you did. Because I got some answers for you.

**Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.**

Even with already having millions of known and unknown blogs out there I still wanted to have my own. All because I too wanted to *share what I know*!
You heard it, I started this blog with the primary focus being to share the knowledge what I have gained.
Just As I quoted above, one has to learn from other's mistake. So *I will trying to help people to learn from my mistakes*
so that they will progress faster with what they are doing and won't have to spend extra time on a mistake.
I am doing all this because I know how stupid it feels when you realize what mistakes you have done.

## What I will be doing
By now, it is obvious that you might be wondering, *What will you be blogging about?*

And here's my answer:
  - Technology related stuffs I have learned
  - New stuffs that my fellow readers should know about
  - Hot topics that my fellow readers might find interesting
  - Personal experiences

Apart from these points, I will also be looking forward for some feedacks from you to keep improving myself, becuase **No one is perfect!** and *I have yet lots to learn*!
