		<p>
			The blog articles here are the result of problems to do lots of stuffs. On addition to that, there were no good articles to help through the problem always. Thus this blog was started to help lots of people <i>Like me</i> to help find an easy and effictive solution. The blog articles are supposed to have the solution to some problems that I faced and also articles to help beter understand some stuffs. But I cannot tell these are the best ones you can find around. So feedbacks regarding the article are always welcome.

		<div class="text-center">
			<b-img-lazy fluid src="@/assets/img/welcome.png" title="welcome to the blog" alt="welcome" />
		</div>
		<div class="separator mt-4">
			<span class="h2 font-weight-bold">Contributing</span>
		</div>
		<p>
			If you want to contribute to the blog in any way then you are more than welcome! <b>The more the merrier</b>, Right? Thus any sort of contributions to the blog is highly appreciated.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first and the most important method of contributing to the blog is by providing feedbacks about the articles and the blog itself. If you find any mistakes in the blog articles, or if you think they can be improved, or if you think there is place for improvement, or anything else regarding the article, then you can leave the comment for that specific article. <i>All the comments are always read!</i> You can even open an issue in the github repository specifying the issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second and also a very helpful method of contributing to the blog is by writing blog articles. This blog is an <b>open sourced</b>, <b>markdown powered</b> blog hosted over at <b>netlify</b>. The source code is available at github under the <b>MIT license</b>. <i>(Github linked below)</i> So if you got an awesome idea that can be helpful to people, then you can simply open an pull request in the github repo, and it will be available in the blog if approved. <i>Will be approved for sure if it is helpful in any way.</i> But if you are unsure about writing the entire article, then you can simply send the prototype of the article or even the concept of the article through github issues or mail me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another way of contributing is by improving the designs of the blog. Although the design are acceptable at the moment, but I strongly agree that it can be improved a lot. Even the home page is not catchy at all. So any improvement are accepted at the moment. All the improvements are to be done through github..
